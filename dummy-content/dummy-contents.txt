You mean it controls your actions?
Partially, but it also obeys your commands. What?!
I suggest you try it again, Luke.
This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.
Escape is not his plan.
I must face him, alone.
I\'m surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself.
Don\'t act so surprised, Your Highness.
You weren\'t on any mercy mission this time.
Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies.
I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.

There\'s nothing for me here now.
I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.

Let\'s blow this thing and go home!
As you wish.
I want to come with you to Alderaan.
There\'s nothing for me here now.

What?!
What good is a reward if you ain\'t around to use it?

It\'s more like ... suicide.
Ye-ha!

The swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land.
On second thoughts, let\'s not go there.
It is a silly place.
Why do you think that she is a witch?
The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice!
Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government.
Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.
It\'s only a model.
What do you mean?
The nose?

All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit ... that\'s why I\'m transferring to business school!
Shut up and get to the point!
No!
Don\'t jump!
The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires!
In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up!
Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.

In common language usage, "fruit" normally means the fleshy seed-associated structures of a plant that are sweet or sour and edible in the raw state, such as apples, oranges, grapes, strawberries, bananas, and lemons.
On the other hand, the botanical sense of "fruit" includes many structures that are not commonly called "fruits", such as bean pods, corn kernels, wheat grains, and tomatoes.

Some vegetables also contain fiber, important for gastrointestinal function.
Vegetables contain important nutrients necessary for healthy hair and skin as well.
A person who refrains from dairy and meat products, and eats only plants (including vegetables) is known as a vegan.
Some vegetables can be consumed raw, while some, such as cassava, must be cooked to destroy certain natural toxins or microbes in order to be edible.
A number of processed food items available on the market contain vegetable ingredients and can be referred to as "vegetable derived" products.
These products may or may not maintain the nutritional integrity of the vegetable used to produce them.
Of all the world\'s nations, China is the leading cultivator of vegetables, with top productions in potato, onions, cabbage, lettuce, tomatoes and broccoli.

The fruit is rich in lycopene, which may have beneficial health effects.
